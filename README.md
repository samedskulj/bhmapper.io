# mapper.io
A simple web app where you can look at the world map and also interact with her. It is made using React, 

# Why it is made?

Here is why: 
* Improving React and Mapbox API knowledge as a junior fullstack developer
* Making sure to know how exactly everything works in the app.

# How to use the app
In this paragraph I will try to describe you how to use the app, if you want to work on it.

# Usage
There are three sections on this website:
* Main screen
* Map Screen

### Main screen 

On the main screen you can see all about the website itself and the specific modern/history looking design. The whole main screen of the website and the UI design can be found on the Dribbble site. I took a inspiration from it!

### Map screen
On this screen, you can see all of the history maps of Bosnia. You can check out the description and the stories of the certain period. You can learn a lot just by reading this little (I made a effor to pick up best possible information that are not boring to read). Also, on the right side there is a map which you can interact with. If you do not like minimal design, do not worry, there is a ***arrow*** at the top of the page.
